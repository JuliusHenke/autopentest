# AutoPentest

In this research project, the goal is to see how well
the penetration testing stages from network enumer-
ation to exploitation of vulnerabilities can be auto-
mated. We want to integrate the most recent Ope-
nAI provided LLM GPT-4o with an Artificial Intel-
ligence (AI) agent framework such as AutoGPT or
Langchain. These frameworks allow us to plan sub-
tasks for a broader goal, keep efficient memory of the
current progress towards the goal and allow the in-
tegration of external data sources to fetch up-to-date
information.
